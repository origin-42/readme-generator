### Motivation

Uploading many projects online requires a lot of time writing and remembering information to include in a readme, whilst also ensuring correct formatting. Here we can simply type the desired information and formatting will be completed consistently, whilst ensuring all information is entered.

### Problem

Saves time searching for information that will be the same everytime. Ensures consistency across applications. Clean and presenteable README.md file. 

### Information

The purpose of this application additionally served to further my knowledge with the enquirer package for prompts made with node.js.

## Requirements

Node will be required to this this application on a local terminal. 

## Further Developments

### Additional Features

- Updates to inquirer confirmation prompts will require further validation to improve exceptions when a user enters any character, rather than just 'n' to omit a feature. 

- Allow a user to begin application and add additional information pertaining to how the applicaion works prior to running in the terminal to provide additional context.

- Allow users to inser information anywhere they wish or rather "sort" where features will be added after user finished entering information.

### Further Changes

- Unable to add colouring to prefix information due to requirments of altering module path which is changed when a user downloads inquirer. Potential to add adjustment to alter return response to questions entered.

- Further spacing and UI changes required.

- Further implementation of promise handling could server to refractor code.
